# Personality Prediction ML System

This project implements a machine learning–based personality prediction system developed as part of the CIS6005 – Computational Intelligence coursework.

The system predicts whether an individual is an Introvert or Extrovert based on behavioral and social attributes using supervised machine learning techniques.
