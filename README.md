# Machine Learning Personality Prediction System

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning–based personality prediction system, fulfilling the ["MachineLearning Approach to Personality prediction"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ml-approach-to-personality)  Kaggle competition.

The system predicts whether an individual is an Introvert or Extrovert based on behavioral and social attributes using supervised machine learning techniques.
