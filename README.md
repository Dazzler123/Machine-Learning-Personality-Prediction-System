# Machine Learning Personality Prediction System

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning–based personality prediction system developed as part of the "MachineLearning Approach to Personality prediction" Kaggle competition.

The system predicts whether an individual is an Introvert or Extrovert based on behavioral and social attributes using supervised machine learning techniques.
